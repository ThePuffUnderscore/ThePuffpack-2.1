Geometry Dash Performance Fix
By SMJS & Cos8o
Version 1.0

This simple program applies some patches to GD to make it run better.

Supported game versions:
-2.113 (latest, as of writing this [19th May, 2020])

HOW TO
There's two way to apply the patches:
1) Provide the path to the executable as an argument: open the program
from the cmd with the path of the exe as an argument; for example:
> PerformanceFix "C:\path\to\GeometryDash.exe"
2) Dynamic patcher: run the program and GD at the same time, then close
the game when asked. The program will automatically find the path for
the executable. NOTE: there's a bug with this method, which will fail
if a folder named "Geometry Dash" is opened. Either close the folder,
or use the first method.

Happy gaming ;)
