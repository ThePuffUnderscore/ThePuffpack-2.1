FOR A VIDEO GUIDE, GO TO [the youtube tutorial doesnt exist yet lmao it will for the public release].


	Installing ThePuffpack 2.1
This will install the base texture pack. You must do this before installing add-ons. Performance/Gradient Fix and RandomOrbColors installation is recommended after this as well.

If you have TextureLdr this process is very intuitive:

- Navigate to the TextureLdr screen in Geometry Dash. Click the button at the top right of the main menu to open the packs folder.

- Drag the Resources folder from ThePuffpack 2.1 into your packs folder. Rename it to whatever you want to remind you of what it is.

- Go back into Geometry Dash and click the refresh button at the bottom right of the screen to refresh your installed packs.

- Move the texture pack from the "All" list over to the "Applied" list.

- You're done! Hit apply to refresh the textures and apply the changes.

If you do not have TextureLdr the process is a little more perminant and hands-on:

- Navigate to your Geometry Dash directory in Program Files. The directory should be Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Geometry Dash

- Backup the folder inside your Geometry Dash directory titled "Resources" somewhere in case you decide to uninstall the texture pack.

- Drag the Resources folder from ThePuffpack 2.1 into your Geometry Dash directory and click "Replace the files in this destination"

- You're done! If the game is open, make sure to restart the game or switch the Texture Quality to apply the changes. You may now proceed onto the next installations.


# Installing Performance/Gradient Fix
This will patch Geometry Dash to allow for rendering gradients correctly. It is highly recommended to install this as it's very easy and makes a big difference. If for whatever reason you're unable to install this, consider using the No Gradient Fix addon.

- Make sure your Geometry Dash folder is closed! The auto installer may not work otherwise.

- With Geometry Dash open, run PerformanceFix.exe. 

- When the installer window tells you to close the game, close the game. The patcher should recognize the game, find the exe file to patch, and apply the patch.

- You're done! Press any key in the installer to exit or just click the x or something idk you can even use task manager up to you.

(If this method did not work, try Method 1 listed in the ReadMe in the Performance&Gradient fix folder)

This will randomize the color of the Star Bit textures upon spawn, making them more like Star Bits.  If you do not have a modded client, use the No Orb Color Mod Fix add-on.

- Navigate to Geometry Dash directory again.

- Locate your mods folder. The names of this may differ between clients. For the sake of example, with Mega Hack v7 Pro the name of this folder is "extensions." It might just be named "mods." Check your clients info or documentation.

- Place RandomOrbColors.dll in your mods folder. (Don't bother putting it directly in your Geometry Dash folder. It won't work.)

- You're done! If the game was open, make sure to restart the game to apply the change.

If you are not using TextureLdr, make sure to do this AFTER installing the base texture pack. 

TextureLdr makes installing add-ons very intuitive.

- Navigate to the TextureLdr menu in Geometry Dash and click the top right button to open the packs folder.

- Place the add-on folder straight in the packs folder.

- Go back into Geometry Dash and click the refresh button at the bottom right of the screen to refresh your installed packs.

- Move the add-on from the "All" list over to the "Applied" list. MAKE SURE THE ADD-ON IS ABOVE THE BASE TEXTURE PACK IN THE LIST. It will not do anything otherwise.

- You're done! Hit apply to refresh the textures and apply the changes.

If you do not have TextureLdr, the installation is very slightly different from installing the base texture pack, but every add-on is installed the same way.

- Choose the add-on you'd like to install. Enter the folder and Copy the files inside the add-ons folder.

- Open the Resources folder in your Geometry Dash directory and Paste the add-on files into the Resources folder.

- You're done! Restart the game or switch Texture Qualities to apply the changes.

As of right now, you can currently use 1 Backgrounds add-on, 1 Icons add-on, 1 Menu Music add-on, 1 Menus And More add-on, 1 Particles add-on, 1 Drag Effects add-on, and 1 Trails add-on. Please note that installing more than one of each type of add-on will not work, as the most recently applied add-on will replace the previous one.
